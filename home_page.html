            As a mother, I am always looking for ways to keep my children entertained.
            My kids, ages two to ten, received Scribbles coloring books as a present, and they are really enjoying the coloring, while learning a lot about Torah concepts.
            I haven't refereed a fight in two weeks!

            I run a three year old playgroup out of my home.
            I ordered the Scribbles Alef Beis coloring book when the kids were learning the letters, and I am so happy with the results!
            The kids are having a great time coloring and learning.
            I especially love how the coloring book features pictures which start with each letter, so the kids learn basic Hebrew as well.

        <blockquote>
            I am a first grade Morah, and I am teaching my talmidos about different mitzvos.
            One of the girls in my class knows so much about each mitzvah that I explain.
            Her mother told me that she loves coloring in Scribbles coloring books, which has familiarized her with many Jewish concepts.
            Keep up the great work!
